# ðŸ¦ˆ INTRA-SHARE ðŸ¦ˆ

Welcome to Intra-Share, a desktop application that runs on intra-network and replicates the features of DC++. The application uses various networking, multithreading concepts, and algorithms to achieve the best file transfer speed possible. This application will run on any local area network for chatting and file-sharing purposes. Downloading speed in Intra-Share will always be higher than one can get from torrent or any other website.
